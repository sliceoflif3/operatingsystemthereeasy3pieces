# 31. Semaphores

As we know now, one needs both locks and condition variables to solve a broad range of relevant and interesting concurrency problems. Indeed, Dijkstra and colleagues invented the **semaphore** as a single primitive for all things related to synchronization; as you will see, one can use semaphores as both locks and condition variables.

## 31.1 Semaphores: A Definition

A semaphore is an object with an integer value that we can manipulate with two routines; in the POSIX standard, these routines are sem wait() and sem post(). Because the initial value of the semaphore determines its behavior, before calling any other routine to interact with the semaphore, we must first initialize it to some value, as the code in Figure 31.1 does.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In the figure, we declare a semaphore s and initialize it to the value 1 by passing 1 in as the third argument. The second argument to sem\_init() will be set to 0 in all of the examples we’ll see; this indicates that the semaphore is shared between threads in the same process.

After a semaphore is initialized, we can call one of two functions to interact with it, sem\_wait() or sem\_post(). The behavior of these two functions is seen in Figure 31.2.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (33).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

For now, we are not concerned with the implementation of these routines, which clearly requires some care; with multiple threads calling into sem\_wait() and sem\_post(), there is the obvious need for managing these critical sections. We will now focus on how to use these primitives; later we may discuss how they are built.

We should discuss a few salient aspects of the interfaces here. First, we can see that sem\_wait() will either return right away (because the value of the semaphore was one or higher when we called sem\_wait()), or it will cause the caller to suspend execution waiting for a subsequent post. Of course, multiple calling threads may call into sem wait(), and thus all be queued waiting to be woken.

Second, we can see that sem\_post() does not wait for some particular condition to hold like sem\_wait() does. Rather, it simply increments the value of the semaphore and then, if there is a thread waiting to be woken, wakes one of them up.

Third, the value of the semaphore, when negative, is equal to the number of waiting threads. Though the value generally isn’t seen by users of the semaphores, this invariant is worth knowing and perhaps can help you remember how a semaphore functions.

## 31.2 Binary Semaphores (Locks)

We are now ready to use a semaphore. Our first use will be one with which we are already familiar: using a semaphore as a lock. See Figure 31.3 for a code snippet; therein, you’ll see that we simply surround the critical section of interest with a sem\_wait()/sem\_post() pair. Critical to making this work, though, is the initial value of the semaphore m (initialized to X in the figure). What should X be?

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (43).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Looking back at definition of the sem\_wait() and sem\_post() routines above, we can see that the initial value should be 1.

To make this clear, let’s imagine a scenario with two threads. The first thread (Thread 0) calls sem\_wait(); it will first decrement the value of the semaphore, changing it to 0. Then, it will wait only if the value is not greater than or equal to 0. Because the value is 0, sem wait() will simply return and the calling thread will continue; Thread 0 is now free to enter the critical section. If no other thread tries to acquire the lock while Thread 0 is inside the critical section, when it calls sem\_post(), it will simply restore the value of the semaphore to 1 (and not wake a waiting thread, because there are none). Figure 31.4 shows a trace of this scenario.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (37).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

A more interesting case arises when Thread 0 “holds the lock” (i.e., it has called sem\_wait() but not yet called sem\_post()), and another thread (Thread 1) tries to enter the critical section by calling sem\_wait(). In this case, Thread 1 will decrement the value of the semaphore to -1, and thus wait (putting itself to sleep and relinquishing the processor). When Thread 0 runs again, it will eventually call sem\_post(), incrementing the value of the semaphore back to zero, and then wake the waiting thread (Thread 1), which will then be able to acquire the lock for itself. When Thread 1 finishes, it will again increment the value of the semaphore, restoring it to 1 again.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (23).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Figure 31.5 shows a trace of this example. In addition to thread actions, the figure shows the scheduler state of each thread: Run (the thread is running), Ready (i.e., runnable but not running), and Sleep (the thread is blocked). Note that Thread 1 goes into the sleeping state when it tries to acquire the already-held lock; only when Thread 0 runs again can Thread 1 be awoken and potentially run again.

Thus we are able to use semaphores as locks. Because locks only have two states (held and not held), we sometimes call a semaphore used as a lock a **binary semaphore**. Note that if you are using a semaphore only in this binary fashion, it could be implemented in a simpler manner than the generalized semaphores we present here.

## 31.3 Semaphores For Ordering

Semaphores are also useful to order events in a concurrent program. For example, a thread may wish to wait for a list to become non-empty, so it can delete an element from it. In this pattern of usage, we often find one thread waiting for something to happen, and another thread making that something happen and then signaling that it has happened, thus waking the waiting thread. We are thus using the semaphore as an **ordering** primitive (similar to our use of **condition variables** earlier).

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (25).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

A simple example is as follows. Imagine a thread creates another thread and then wants to wait for it to complete its execution (Figure 31.6). When this program runs, we would like to see the following:

```
parent: begin
child
parent: end
```

The question, then, is how to use a semaphore to achieve this effect; as it turns out, the answer is relatively easy to understand. As you can see in the code, the parent simply calls sem\_wait() and the child sem\_post() to wait for the condition of the child finishing its execution to become true. However, this raises the question: what should the initial value of this semaphore be?

The answer, of course, is that the value of the semaphore should be set to is 0. There are two cases to consider. First, let us assume that the parent creates the child but the child has not run yet (i.e., it is sitting in a ready queue but not running). In this case (Figure 31.7), the parent will call sem\_wait() before the child has called sem\_post(); we’d like the parent to wait for the child to run. The only way this will happen is if the value of the semaphore is not greater than 0; hence, 0 is the initial value. The parent runs, decrements the semaphore (to -1), then waits (sleeping). When the child finally runs, it will call sem post(), increment the value of the semaphore to 0, and wake the parent, which will then return from sem wait() and finish the program.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The second case (Figure 31.8) occurs when the child runs to completion before the parent gets a chance to call sem wait(). In this case, the child will first call sem post(), thus incrementing the value of the semaphore from 0 to 1. When the parent then gets a chance to run, it will call sem wait() and find the value of the semaphore to be 1; the parent will thus decrement the value (to 0) and return from sem wait() without waiting, also achieving the desired effect.

## 31.4 The Producer/Consumer (Bounded Buffer) Problem

The next problem we will confront in this chapter is known as the **producer/consumer problem**, or sometimes as the **bounded buffer problem.**

### First Attempt

Our first attempt at solving the problem introduces two semaphores, empty and full, which the threads will use to indicate when a buffer entry has been emptied or filled, respectively. The code for the put and get routines is in Figure 31.9, and our attempt at solving the producer and consumer problem is in Figure 31.10.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (22).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (21).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In this example, the producer first waits for a buffer to become empty in order to put data into it, and the consumer similarly waits for a buffer to become filled before using it. Let us first imagine that MAX=1 (there is only one buffer in the array), and see if this works.

Imagine again there are two threads, a producer and a consumer. Let us examine a specific scenario on a single CPU. Assume the consumer gets to run first. Thus, the consumer will hit Line C1 in Figure 31.10, calling sem\_wait(\&full). Because full was initialized to the value 0, the call will decrement full (to -1), block the consumer, and wait for another thread to call sem\_post() on full, as desired.&#x20;

Assume the producer then runs. It will hit Line P1, thus calling the sem\_wait(\&empty) routine. Unlike the consumer, the producer will continue through this line, because empty was initialized to the value MAX (in this case, 1). Thus, empty will be decremented to 0 and the producer will put a data value into the first entry of buffer (Line P2). The producer will then continue on to P3 and call sem post(\&full), changing the value of the full semaphore from -1 to 0 and waking the consumer (e.g., move it from blocked to ready).

In this case, one of two things could happen. If the producer continues to run, it will loop around and hit Line P1 again. This time, however, it would block, as the empty semaphore’s value is 0. If the producer instead was interrupted and the consumer began to run, it would return from sem\_wait(\&full) (Line C1), find that the buffer was full, and consume it. In either case, we achieve the desired behavior.

Let us now imagine that MAX is greater than 1 (say MAX=10). For this example, let us assume that there are multiple producers and multiple consumers. We now have a problem: a race condition.

OK, let’s understand the issue. Imagine two producers (Pa and Pb) both calling into put() at roughly the same time. Assume producer Pa gets to run first, and just starts to fill the first buffer entry (fill=0 at Line F1). Before Pa gets a chance to increment the fill counter to 1, it is interrupted. Producer Pb starts to run, and at Line F1 it also puts its data into the 0th element of buffer, which means that the old data there is overwritten! This action is a no-no; we don’t want any data from the producer to be lost.

### A Solution: Adding Mutual Exclusion

As you can see, what we’ve forgotten here is mutual exclusion. The filling of a buffer and incrementing of the index into the buffer is a critical section, and thus must be guarded carefully. So let’s use our friend the binary semaphore and add some locks. Figure 31.11 shows our attempt.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Now we’ve added some locks around the entire put()/get() parts of the code, as indicated by the NEW LINE comments. That seems like the right idea, but it also doesn’t work. Why? Deadlock.

### Avoiding Deadlock

Imagine two threads, one producer and one consumer. The consumer gets to run first. It acquires the mutex (Line C0), and then calls sem wait() on the full semaphore (Line C1); because there is no data yet, this call causes the consumer to block and thus yield the CPU; importantly, though, the consumer still holds the lock.

A producer then runs. It has data to produce and if it were able to run, it would be able to wake the consumer thread and all would be good. Unfortunately, the first thing it does is call sem wait() on the binary mutex semaphore (Line P0). The lock is already held. Hence, the producer is now stuck waiting too.

There is a simple cycle here. The consumer holds the mutex and is waiting for the someone to signal full. The producer could signal full but is waiting for the mutex. Thus, the producer and consumer are each stuck waiting for each other: a classic deadlock.

### At Last, A Working Solution

To solve this problem, we simply must reduce the scope of the lock. Figure 31.12 shows the correct solution. As you can see, we simply move the mutex acquire and release to be just around the critical section; the full and empty wait and signal code is left outside. The result is a simple and working bounded buffer, a commonly-used pattern in multithreaded programs. Understand it now; use it later.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## 31.5 Reader-Writer Locks

Another classic problem stems from the desire for a more flexible locking primitive that admits that different data structure accesses might require different kinds of locking. For example, imagine a number of concurrent list operations, including inserts and simple lookups. While inserts change the state of the list (and thus a traditional critical section makes sense), lookups simply read the data structure; as long as we can guarantee that no insert is on-going, we can allow many lookups to proceed concurrently. The special type of lock we will now develop to support this type of operation is known as a **reader-writer lock**. The code for such a lock is available in Figure 31.13.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (40).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The code is pretty simple. If some thread wants to update the data structure in question, it should call the new pair of synchronization operations: rwlock\_acquire\_writelock(), to acquire a write lock, and rwlock\_release\_writelock(), to release it. Internally, these simply use the writelock semaphore to ensure that only a single writer can acquire the lock and thus enter the critical section to update the data structure in question.

More interesting is the pair of routines to acquire and release read locks. When acquiring a read lock, the reader first acquires lock and then increments the readers variable to track how many readers are currently inside the data structure. The important step then taken within rwlock\_acquire\_readlock() occurs when the first reader acquires the lock; in that case, the reader also acquires the write lock by calling sem\_wait() on the writelock semaphore, and then releasing the lock by calling sem\_post().

Thus, once a reader has acquired a read lock, more readers will be allowed to acquire the read lock too; however, any thread that wishes to acquire the write lock will have to wait until all readers are finished; the last one to exit the critical section calls sem\_post() on “writelock” and thus enables a waiting writer to acquire the lock.

This approach works (as desired), but does have some negatives, especially when it comes to fairness. In particular, it would be relatively easy for readers to starve writers. More sophisticated solutions to this problem exist.

Finally, it should be noted that reader-writer locks should be used with some caution. They often add more overhead (especially with more sophisticated implementations), and thus do not end up speeding up performance as compared to just using simple and fast locking primitives. Either way, they showcase once again how we can use semaphores in an interesting and useful way.

## 31.6 The Dining Philosophers

One of the most famous concurrency problems posed, and solved, by Dijkstra, is known as the **dining philosopher’s problem**. The problem is famous because it is fun and somewhat intellectually interesting; however, its practical utility is low. However, its fame forces its inclusion here; indeed, you might be asked about it on some interview, and you’d really hate your OS professor if you miss that question and don’t get the job.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (26).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The basic setup for the problem is this (as shown in Figure 31.14): assume there are five “philosophers” sitting around a table. Between each pair of philosophers is a single fork (and thus, five total). The philosophers each have times where they think, and don’t need any forks, and times where they eat. In order to eat, a philosopher needs two forks, both the one on their left and the one on their right. The contention for these forks, and the synchronization problems that ensue, are what makes this a problem we study in concurrent programming.

Here is the basic loop of each philosopher, assuming each has a unique thread identifier p from 0 to 4 (inclusive):

```
while (1) {
    think();
    get_forks(p);
    eat();
    put_forks(p);
}
```

The key challenge, then, is to write the routines get forks() and put forks() such that there is no deadlock, no philosopher starves and never gets to eat, and concurrency is high (i.e., as many philosophers can eat at the same time as possible).

Following Downey’s solutions, we’ll use a few helper functions to get us towards a solution. They are:

```
int left(int p) { return p; }
int right(int p) { return (p + 1) % 5; }
```

When philosopher p wishes to refer to the fork on their left, they simply call left(p). Similarly, the fork on the right of a philosopher p is referred to by calling right(p); the modulo operator therein handles the one case where the last philosopher (p=4) tries to grab the fork on their right, which is fork 0.

We’ll also need some semaphores to solve this problem. Let us assume we have five, one for each fork: sem\_t forks\[5].

### Broken Solution

We attempt our first solution to the problem. Assume we initialize each semaphore (in the forks array) to a value of 1. Assume also that each philosopher knows its own number (p). We can thus write the get forks() and put forks() routine (Figure 31.15).

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (20).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The intuition behind this (broken) solution is as follows. To acquire the forks, we simply grab a “lock” on each one: first the one on the left, and then the one on the right. When we are done eating, we release them. Simple, no? Unfortunately, in this case, simple means broken.

The problem is **deadlock**. If each philosopher happens to grab the fork on their left before any philosopher can grab the fork on their right, each will be stuck holding one fork and waiting for another, forever. Specifically, philosopher 0 grabs fork 0, philosopher 1 grabs fork 1, philosopher 2 grabs fork 2, philosopher 3 grabs fork 3, and philosopher 4 grabs fork 4; all the forks are acquired, and all the philosophers are stuck waiting for a fork that another philosopher possesses. We’ll study deadlock in more detail soon; for now, it is safe to say that this is not a working solution.

### A Solution: Breaking The Dependency

The simplest way to attack this problem is to change how forks are acquired by at least one of the philosophers; indeed, this is how Dijkstra himself solved the problem. Specifically, let’s assume that philosopher 4 (the highest numbered one) gets the forks in a different order than the others (Figure 31.16); the put forks() code remains the same.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (41).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Because the last philosopher tries to grab right before left, there is no situation where each philosopher grabs one fork and is stuck waiting for another; the cycle of waiting is broken.

There are other “famous” problems like this one, e.g., the **cigarette smoker’s problem** or the **sleeping barber problem**. Most of them are just excuses to think about concurrency; some of them have fascinating names.

## 31.7 Thread Throttling

One other simple use case for semaphores arises on occasion, and thus we present it here. The specific problem is this: how can a programmer prevent “too many” threads from doing something at once and bogging the system down? Answer: decide upon a threshold for “too many”, and then use a semaphore to limit the number of threads concurrently executing the piece of code in question. We call this approach **throttling**, and consider it a form of **admission contro**l.

Let’s consider a more specific example. Imagine that you create hundreds of threads to work on some problem in parallel. However, in a certain part of the code, each thread acquires a large amount of memory to perform part of the computation; let’s call this part of the code the memory-intensive region. If all of the threads enter the memory-intensive region at the same time, the sum of all the memory allocation requests will exceed the amount of physical memory on the machine. As a result, the machine will start thrashing (i.e., swapping pages to and from the disk), and the entire computation will slow to a crawl.

A simple semaphore can solve this problem. By initializing the value of the semaphore to the maximum number of threads you wish to enter the memory-intensive region at once, and then putting a sem\_wait() and sem\_post() around the region, a semaphore can naturally throttle the number of threads that are ever concurrently in the dangerous region of the code.

## 31.8 How To Implement Semaphores

Finally, let’s use our low-level synchronization primitives, locks and condition variables, to build our own version of semaphores called ... (drum roll here) ... Zemaphores. This task is fairly straightforward, as you can see in Figure 31.17.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (28).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In the code above, we use just one lock and one condition variable, plus a state variable to track the value of the semaphore.

One subtle difference between our Zemaphore and pure semaphores as defined by Dijkstra is that we don’t maintain the invariant that the value of the semaphore, when negative, reflects the number of waiting threads; indeed, the value will never be lower than zero. This behavior is easier to implement and matches the current Linux implementation.

Curiously, building condition variables out of semaphores is a much trickier proposition. Some highly experienced concurrent programmers tried to do this in the Windows environment, and many different bugs ensued

## 31.9 Summary

Semaphores are a powerful and flexible primitive for writing concurrent programs. Some programmers use them exclusively, shunning locks and condition variables, due to their simplicity and utility.
