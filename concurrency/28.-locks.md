# 28. Locks

From the introduction to concurrency, we saw one of the fundamental problems in concurrent programming: we would like to execute a series of instructions atomically, but due to the presence of interrupts on a single processor (or multiple threads executing on multiple processors concurrently), we couldn’t. In this chapter, we thus attack this problem directly, with the introduction of something referred to as a **lock**. Programmers annotate source code with locks, putting them around critical sections, and thus ensure that any such critical section executes as if it were a single atomic instruction.

## 28.1 Locks: The Basic Idea

As an example, assume our critical section looks like this, the canonical update of a shared variable:

```
balance = balance + 1;
```

Of course, other critical sections are possible, such as adding an element to a linked list or other more complex updates to shared structures, but we’ll just keep to this simple example for now. To use a lock, we add some code around the critical section like this:

```
1 lock_t mutex; // some globally-allocated lock ’mutex’
2 ...
3 lock(&mutex);
4 balance = balance + 1;
5 unlock(&mutex);
```

A lock is just a variable, and thus to use one, you must declare a **lock variable** of some kind (such as mutex above). This lock variable (or just “lock” for short) holds the state of the lock at any instant in time. It is either **available** (or **unlocked** or **free**) and thus no thread holds the lock, or **acquired** (or **locked** or **held**), and thus exactly one thread holds the lock and presumably is in a critical section. We could store other information in the data type as well, such as which thread holds the lock, or a queue for ordering lock acquisition, but information like that is hidden from the user of the lock.

The semantics of the `lock()` and `unlock()` routines are simple. Calling the routine `lock()` tries to acquire the lock; if no other thread holds the lock (i.e., it is free), the thread will acquire the lock and enter the critical section; this thread is sometimes said to be the **owner** of the lock. If another thread then calls `lock()` on that same lock variable (mutex in this example), it will not return while the lock is held by another thread; in this way, other threads are prevented from entering the critical section while the first thread that holds the lock is in there.

Once the owner of the lock calls `unlock()`, the lock is now available (free) again. If no other threads are waiting for the lock (i.e., no other thread has called lock() and is stuck therein), the state of the lock is simply changed to free. If there are waiting threads (stuck in lock()), one of them will (eventually) notice (or be informed of) this change of the lock’s state, acquire the lock, and enter the critical section.

Locks provide some minimal amount of control over scheduling to programmers. In general, we view threads as entities created by the programmer but scheduled by the OS, in any fashion that the OS chooses. Locks yield some of that control back to the programmer; by putting a lock around a section of code, the programmer can guarantee that no more than a single thread can ever be active within that code. Thus locks help transform the chaos that is traditional OS scheduling into a more controlled activity.

## 28.2 Pthread Locks

The name that the POSIX library uses for a lock is a **mutex**, as it is used to provide **mutual exclusion** between threads, i.e., if one thread is in the critical section, it excludes the others from entering until it has completed the section. Thus, when you see the following POSIX threads code, you should understand that it is doing the same thing as above (we again use our wrappers that check for errors upon lock and unlock):

```
1 pthread_mutex_t lock = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
2
3 Pthread_mutex_lock(&lock); // wrapper; exits on failure
4 balance = balance + 1;
5 Pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock);
```

You might also notice here that the POSIX version passes a variable to lock and unlock, as we may be using different locks to protect different variables. Doing so can increase concurrency: instead of one big lock that is used any time any critical section is accessed (a **coarse-grained** locking strategy), one will often protect different data and data structures with different locks, thus allowing more threads to be in locked code at once (a more **fine-grained** approach).

## 28.3 Building A Lock

To build a working lock, we will need some help from our old friend, the hardware, as well as our good pal, the OS. Over the years, a number of different hardware primitives have been added to the instruction sets of various computer architectures. We will also study how the OS gets involved to complete the picture and enable us to build a sophisticated locking library.

## 28.4 Evaluating Locks

Before building any locks, we should first understand what our goals are, and thus we ask how to evaluate the efficacy of a particular lock implementation. To evaluate whether a lock works (and works well), we should establish some basic criteria. The first is whether the lock does its basic task, which is to provide **mutual exclusion**. Basically, does the lock work, preventing multiple threads from entering a critical section?

The second is **fairness**. Does each thread contending for the lock get a fair shot at acquiring it once it is free? Another way to look at this is by examining the more extreme case: does any thread contending for the lock **starve** while doing so, thus never obtaining it?

The final criterion is **performance**, specifically the time overheads added by using the lock. There are a few different cases that are worth considering here. One is the case of no contention; when a single thread is running and grabs and releases the lock, what is the overhead of doing so? Another is the case where multiple threads are contending for the lock on a single CPU; in this case, are there performance concerns? Finally, how does the lock perform when there are multiple CPUs involved, and threads on each contending for the lock? By comparing these different scenarios, we can better understand the performance impact of using various locking techniques, as described below.

## 28.5 Controlling Interrupts

One of the earliest solutions used to provide mutual exclusion was to disable interrupts for critical sections; this solution was invented for single-processor systems. The code would look like this:

```
1 void lock() {
2 DisableInterrupts();
3 }
4 void unlock() {
5 EnableInterrupts();
6 }
```

Assume we are running on such a single-processor system. By turning off interrupts (using some kind of special hardware instruction) before entering a critical section, we ensure that the code inside the critical section will not be interrupted, and thus will execute as if it were atomic. When we are finished, we re-enable interrupts (again, via a hardware instruction) and thus the program proceeds as usual.

The main positive of this approach is its simplicity. You certainly don’t have to scratch your head too hard to figure out why this works.

The negatives, unfortunately, are many. First, this approach requires us to allow any calling thread to perform a privileged operation (turning interrupts on and off), and thus trust that this facility is not abused. As you already know, any time we are required to trust an arbitrary program, we are probably in trouble. Here, the trouble manifests in numerous ways: a greedy program could call lock() at the beginning of its execution and thus monopolize the processor; worse, an errant or malicious program could call lock() and go into an endless loop. In this latter case, the OS never regains control of the system, and there is only one recourse: restart the system. Using interrupt disabling as a general purpose synchronization solution requires too much trust in applications.

Second, the approach does not work on multiprocessors. If multiple threads are running on different CPUs, and each try to enter the same critical section, it does not matter whether interrupts are disabled; threads will be able to run on other processors, and thus could enter the critical section. As multiprocessors are now commonplace, our general solution will have to do better than this.

Third, turning off interrupts for extended periods of time can lead to interrupts becoming lost, which can lead to serious systems problems. Imagine, for example, if the CPU missed the fact that a disk device has finished a read request. How will the OS know to wake the process waiting for said read?

Finally, and probably least important, this approach can be inefficient. Compared to normal instruction execution, code that masks or unmasks interrupts tends to be executed slowly by modern CPUs.

For these reasons, turning off interrupts is only used in limited contexts as a mutual-exclusion primitive. For example, in some cases an operating system itself will use interrupt masking to guarantee atomicity when accessing its own data structures, or at least to prevent certain messy interrupt handling situations from arising. This usage makes sense, as the trust issue disappears inside the OS, which always trusts itself to perform privileged operations anyhow.

## 28.6 A Failed Attempt: Just Using Loads/Stores

To move beyond interrupt-based techniques, we will have to rely on CPU hardware and the instructions it provides us to build a proper lock. Let’s first try to build a simple lock by using a single flag variable. In this failed attempt, we’ll see some of the basic ideas needed to build a lock, and (hopefully) see why just using a single variable and accessing it via normal loads and stores is insufficient.

In this first attempt (Figure 28.1), the idea is quite simple: use a simple variable (flag) to indicate whether some thread has possession of a lock. The first thread that enters the critical section will call lock(), which tests whether the flag is equal to 1 (in this case, it is not), and then sets the flag to 1 to indicate that the thread now holds the lock. When finished with the critical section, the thread calls unlock() and clears the flag, thus indicating that the lock is no longer held.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (42) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If another thread happens to call lock() while that first thread is in the critical section, it will simply spin-wait in the while loop for that thread to call unlock() and clear the flag. Once that first thread does so, the waiting thread will fall out of the while loop, set the flag to 1 for itself, and proceed into the critical section.

Unfortunately, the code has two problems: one of correctness, and another of performance. The correctness problem is simple to see once you get used to thinking about concurrent programming. Imagine the code interleaving in Figure 28.2; assume flag=0 to begin.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

As you can see from this interleaving, with timely (untimely?) interrupts, we can easily produce a case where both threads set the flag to 1 and both threads are thus able to enter the critical section. This behavior is what professionals call “bad” – we have obviously failed to provide the most basic requirement: providing mutual exclusion.

The performance problem, which we will address more later on, is the fact that the way a thread waits to acquire a lock that is already held: it endlessly checks the value of flag, a technique known as **spin-waiting**. Spin-waiting wastes time waiting for another thread to release a lock. The waste is exceptionally high on a uniprocessor, where the thread that the waiter is waiting for cannot even run (at least, until a context switch occurs)!

## 28.7 Building Working Spin Locks with Test-And-Set

Because disabling interrupts does not work on multiple processors, and because simple approaches using loads and stores (as shown above) don’t work, system designers started to invent hardware support for locking.

The simplest bit of hardware support to understand is known as a **test-and-set** (or **atomic exchange**) instruction. We define what the test-and-set instruction does via the following C code snippet:

```
1 int TestAndSet(int *old_ptr, int new) {
2     int old = *old_ptr; // fetch old value at old_ptr
3     *old_ptr = new; // store ’new’ into old_ptr
4     return old; // return the old value
5 }
```

What the test-and-set instruction does is as follows. It returns the old value pointed to by the old ptr, and simultaneously updates said value to new. The key, of course, is that this sequence of operations is performed atomically. The reason it is called “test and set” is that it enables you to “test” the old value (which is what is returned) while simultaneously “setting” the memory location to a new value; as it turns out, this slightly more powerful instruction is enough to build a simple spin lock, as we now examine in Figure 28.3.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (37) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Let’s make sure we understand why this lock works. Imagine first the case where a thread calls `lock()` and no other thread currently holds the lock; thus, flag should be 0. When the thread calls `TestAndSet(flag, 1)`, the routine will return the old value of flag, which is 0; thus, the calling thread, which is testing the value of flag, will not get caught spinning in the while loop and will acquire the lock. The thread will also atomically set the value to 1, thus indicating that the lock is now held. When the thread is finished with its critical section, it calls `unlock()` to set the flag back to zero.

The second case we can imagine arises when one thread already has the lock held (i.e., flag is 1). In this case, this thread will call lock() and then call `TestAndSet(flag, 1)` as well. This time, `TestAndSet()` will return the old value at flag, which is 1 (because the lock is held), while simultaneously setting it to 1 again. As long as the lock is held by another thread, `TestAndSet()` will repeatedly return 1, and thus this thread will spin and spin until the lock is finally released. When the flag is finally set to 0 by some other thread, this thread will call `TestAndSet()` again, which will now return 0 while atomically setting the value to 1 and thus acquire the lock and enter the critical section.

By making both the **test** (of the old lock value) and **set** (of the new value) a single atomic operation, we ensure that only one thread acquires the lock. And that’s how to build a working mutual exclusion primitive!

You may also now understand why this type of lock is usually referred to as a **spin lock**. It is the simplest type of lock to build, and simply spins, using CPU cycles, until the lock becomes available. To work correctly on a single processor, it requires a **preemptive scheduler** (i.e., one that will interrupt a thread via a timer, in order to run a different thread, from time to time). Without preemption, spin locks don’t make much sense on a single CPU, as a thread spinning on a CPU will never relinquish it.

## 28.8 Evaluating Spin Locks

Given our basic spin lock, we can now evaluate how effective it is along our previously described axes. The most important aspect of a lock is **correctness**: does it provide mutual exclusion? The answer here is yes: the spin lock only allows a single thread to enter the critical section at a time. Thus, we have a correct lock.

The next axis is **fairness**. How fair is a spin lock to a waiting thread? Can you guarantee that a waiting thread will ever enter the critical section? The answer here, unfortunately, is bad news: spin locks don’t provide any fairness guarantees. Indeed, a thread spinning may spin forever, under contention. Simple spin locks (as discussed thus far) are not fair and may lead to starvation.

The final axis is **performance**. What are the costs of using a spin lock? To analyze this more carefully, we suggest thinking about a few different cases. In the first, imagine threads competing for the lock on a single processor; in the second, consider threads spread out across many CPUs.

For spin locks, in the single CPU case, performance overheads can be quite painful; imagine the case where the thread holding the lock is preempted within a critical section. The scheduler might then run every other thread (imagine there are N − 1 others), each of which tries to acquire the lock. In this case, each of those threads will spin for the duration of a time slice before giving up the CPU, a waste of CPU cycles

However, on multiple CPUs, spin locks work reasonably well (if the number of threads roughly equals the number of CPUs). The thinking goes as follows: imagine Thread A on CPU 1 and Thread B on CPU 2, both contending for a lock. If Thread A (CPU 1) grabs the lock, and then Thread B tries to, B will spin (on CPU 2). However, presumably the critical section is short, and thus soon the lock becomes available, and is acquired by Thread B. Spinning to wait for a lock held on another processor doesn’t waste many cycles in this case, and thus can be effective.

## 28.9 Compare-And-Swap

Another hardware primitive that some systems provide is known as the **compare-and-swap** instruction, or **compare-and-exchange**. The C pseudocode for this single instruction is found in Figure 28.4.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (31).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The basic idea is for compare-and-swap to test whether the value at the address specified by ptr is equal to expected; if so, update the memory location pointed to by ptr with the new value. If not, do nothing. In either case, return the original value at that memory location, thus allowing the code calling compare-and-swap to know whether it succeeded or not.

With the compare-and-swap instruction, we can build a lock in a manner quite similar to that with test-and-set. For example, we could just replace the lock() routine above with the following:

```
1 void lock(lock_t *lock) {
2     while (CompareAndSwap(&lock->flag, 0, 1) == 1)
3         ; // spin
4 }
```

The rest of the code is the same as the test-and-set example above. This code works quite similarly; it simply checks if the flag is 0 and if so, atomically swaps in a 1 thus acquiring the lock. Threads that try to acquire the lock while it is held will get stuck spinning until the lock is finally released.

Finally, as you may have sensed, compare-and-swap is a more powerful instruction than test-and-set. We will make some use of this power in the future when we briefly delve into topics such as **lock-free synchronization**. However, if we just build a simple spin lock with it, its behavior is identical to the spin lock we analyzed above.

## 28.10 Load-Linked and Store-Conditional

Some platforms provide a pair of instructions that work in concert to help build critical sections. On the MIPS architecture, for example, the **load-linked** and **store-conditional** instructions can be used in tandem to build locks and other concurrent structures. The C pseudocode for these instructions is as found in Figure 28.5.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (28).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The load-linked operates much like a typical load instruction, and simply fetches a value from memory and places it in a register. The key difference comes with the store-conditional, which only succeeds (and updates the value stored at the address just load-linked from) if no intervening store to the address has taken place. In the case of success, the storeconditional returns 1 and updates the value at ptr to value; if it fails, the value at ptr is not updated and 0 is returned.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (20).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The lock() code is the only interesting piece. First, a thread spins waiting for the flag to be set to 0 (and thus indicate the lock is not held). Once so, the thread tries to acquire the lock via the store-conditional; if it succeeds, the thread has atomically changed the flag’s value to 1 and thus can proceed into the critical section.

Note how failure of the store-conditional might arise. One thread calls lock() and executes the load-linked, returning 0 as the lock is not held. Before it can attempt the store-conditional, it is interrupted and another thread enters the lock code, also executing the load-linked instruction, and also getting a 0 and continuing. At this point, two threads have each executed the load-linked and each are about to attempt the storeconditional. The key feature of these instructions is that only one of these threads will succeed in updating the flag to 1 and thus acquire the lock; the second thread to attempt the store-conditional will fail (because the other thread updated the value of flag between its load-linked and storeconditional) and thus have to try to acquire the lock again.

## 28.11 Fetch-And-Add

One final hardware primitive is the fetch-and-add instruction, which atomically increments a value while returning the old value at a particular address. The C pseudocode for the fetch-and-add instruction looks like this:

```
1 int FetchAndAdd(int *ptr) {
2     int old = *ptr;
3     *ptr = old + 1;
4     return old;
5 }
```

In this example, we’ll use fetch-and-add to build a more interesting ticket lock. The lock and unlock code is found in Figure 28.7.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (40).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Instead of a single value, this solution uses a ticket and turn variable in combination to build a lock. The basic operation is pretty simple: when a thread wishes to acquire a lock, it first does an atomic fetch-and-add on the ticket value; that value is now considered this thread’s “turn” (myturn). The globally shared lock->turn is then used to determine which thread’s turn it is; when (myturn == turn) for a given thread, it is that thread’s turn to enter the critical section. Unlock is accomplished simply by incrementing the turn such that the next waiting thread (if there is one) can now enter the critical section.

Note one important difference with this solution versus our previous attempts: it ensures progress for all threads. Once a thread is assigned its ticket value, it will be scheduled at some point in the future. In our previous attempts, no such guarantee existed; a thread spinning on test-and-set (for example) could spin forever even as other threads acquire and release the lock.

## 28.12 Too Much Spinning: What Now?

Our simple hardware-based locks are simple (only a few lines of code) and they work, which are two excellent properties of any system or code. However, in some cases, these solutions can be quite inefficient. Imagine you are running two threads on a single processor. Now imagine that one thread (thread 0) is in a critical section and thus has a lock held, and unfortunately gets interrupted. The second thread (thread 1) now tries to acquire the lock, but finds that it is held. Thus, it begins to spin. And spin. Then it spins some more. And finally, a timer interrupt goes off, thread 0 is run again, which releases the lock, and finally thread 1 won’t have to spin so much and will be able to acquire the lock. Thus, any time a thread gets caught spinning in a situation like this, it wastes an entire time slice doing nothing but checking a value that isn’t going to change!

Hardware support alone cannot solve the problem. We’ll need OS support too! Let’s now figure out just how that might work.

## 28.13 A Simple Approach: Just Yield, Baby

Hardware support got us pretty far: working locks, and even (as with the case of the ticket lock) fairness in lock acquisition. However, we still have a problem: what to do when a context switch occurs in a critical section, and threads start to spin endlessly, waiting for the interrupted (lock-holding) thread to be run again?

Our first try is a simple and friendly approach: when you are going to spin, instead give up the CPU to another thread.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In this approach, we assume an operating system primitive yield() which a thread can call when it wants to give up the CPU and let another thread run. A thread can be in one of three states (running, ready, or blocked); yield is simply a system call that moves the caller from the **running** state to the **ready** state, and thus promotes another thread to running. Thus, the yielding thread essentially **deschedules** itself.

Think about the example with two threads on one CPU; in this case, our yield-based approach works quite well. If a thread happens to call lock() and find a lock held, it will simply yield the CPU, and thus the other thread will run and finish its critical section. In this simple case, the yielding approach works well.

Let us now consider the case where there are many threads (say 100) contending for a lock repeatedly. In this case, if one thread acquires the lock and is preempted before releasing it, the other 99 will each call lock(), find the lock held, and yield the CPU. Assuming some kind of round-robin scheduler, each of the 99 will execute this run-and-yield pattern before the thread holding the lock gets to run again. While better than our spinning approach (which would waste 99 time slices spinning), this approach is still costly; the cost of a context switch can be substantial, and there is thus plenty of waste.

Worse, we have not tackled the starvation problem at all. A thread may get caught in an endless yield loop while other threads repeatedly enter and exit the critical section.

## 28.14 Using Queues: Sleeping Instead Of Spinning

The real problem with our previous approaches is that they leave too much to chance. The scheduler determines which thread runs next; if the scheduler makes a bad choice, a thread runs that must either spin waiting for the lock (our first approach), or yield the CPU immediately (our second approach). Either way, there is potential for waste and no prevention of starvation.

Thus, we must explicitly exert some control over which thread next gets to acquire the lock after the current holder releases it. To do this, we will need a little more OS support, as well as a queue to keep track of which threads are waiting to acquire the lock.

For simplicity, we will use the support provided by Solaris, in terms of two calls: `park()` to put a calling thread to sleep, and `unpark(threadID)` to wake a particular thread as designated by `threadID`. These two routines can be used in tandem to build a lock that puts a caller to sleep if it tries to acquire a held lock and wakes it when the lock is free. Let’s look at the code in Figure 28.9 to understand one possible use of such primitives.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (26).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We do a couple of interesting things in this example. First, we combine the old test-and-set idea with an explicit queue of lock waiters to make a more efficient lock. Second, we use a queue to help control who gets the lock next and thus avoid starvation.

You might notice how the guard is used), basically as a spin-lock around the flag and queue manipulations the lock is using. This approach thus doesn’t avoid spin-waiting entirely; a thread might be interrupted while acquiring or releasing the lock, and thus cause other threads to spin-wait for this one to run again. However, the time spent spinning is quite limited (just a few instructions inside the lock and unlock code, instead of the user-defined critical section), and thus this approach may be reasonable.

You might also observe that in lock(), when a thread can not acquire the lock (it is already held), we are careful to add ourselves to a queue (by calling the gettid() function to get the thread ID of the current thread), set guard to 0, and yield the CPU.&#x20;

You might further detect that the flag does not get set back to 0 when another thread gets woken up. Why is this? Well, it is not an error, but rather a necessity! When a thread is woken up, it will be as if it is returning from park(); however, it does not hold the guard at that point in the code and thus cannot even try to set the flag to 1. Thus, we just pass the lock directly from the thread releasing the lock to the next thread acquiring it; flag is not set to 0 in-between.

Finally, you might notice the perceived race condition in the solution, just before the call to park(). With just the wrong timing, a thread will be about to park, assuming that it should sleep until the lock is no longer held. A switch at that time to another thread (say, a thread holding the lock) could lead to trouble, for example, if that thread then released the lock. The subsequent park by the first thread would then sleep forever (potentially), a problem sometimes called the **wakeup/waiting race.**

Solaris solves this problem by adding a third system call: setpark(). By calling this routine, a thread can indicate it is about to park. If it then happens to be interrupted and another thread calls unpark before park is actually called, the subsequent park returns immediately instead of sleeping. The code modification, inside of lock(), is quite small:

```
1 queue_add(m->q, gettid());
2 setpark(); // new code
3 m->guard = 0;
```

## 28.15 Different OS, Different Support

We have thus far seen one type of support that an OS can provide in order to build a more efficient lock in a thread library. Other OS’s provide similar support; the details vary.

## 28.16 Two-Phase Locks

**A two-phase lock** realizes that spinning can be useful, particularly if the lock is about to be released. So in the first phase, the lock spins for a while, hoping that it can acquire the lock.&#x20;

However, if the lock is not acquired during the first spin phase, a second phase is entered, where the caller is put to sleep, and only woken up when the lock becomes free later. A generalization of this could spin in a loop for a fixed amount of time before using futex support to sleep.

Two-phase locks are yet another instance of a hybrid approach, where combining two good ideas may indeed yield a better one. Of course, whether it does depends strongly on many things, including the hardware environment, number of threads, and other workload details.

## 28.17 Summary

The above approach shows how real locks are built these days: some hardware support (in the form of a more powerful instruction) plus some operating system support (e.g., in the form of park() and unpark() primitives on Solaris, or futex on Linux). Of course, the details differ, and the exact code to perform such locking is usually highly tuned.
