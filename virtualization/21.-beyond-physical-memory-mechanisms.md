# 21. Beyond Physical Memory: Mechanisms

Thus far, we’ve assumed that an address space is unrealistically small and fits into physical memory. In fact, we’ve been assuming that every address space of every running process fits into memory. We will now relax these big assumptions, and assume that we wish to support many concurrently-running large address spaces.

To do so, we require an additional level in the memory hierarchy. Thus far, we have assumed that all pages reside in physical memory. However, to support large address spaces, the OS will need a place to stash away portions of address spaces that currently aren’t in great demand. In general, the characteristics of such a location are that it should have more capacity than memory; as a result, it is generally slower (if it were faster, we would just use it as memory, no?). In modern systems, this role is usually served by a **hard disk drive**. Thus, in our memory hierarchy, big and slow hard drives sit at the bottom, with memory just above.

One question you might have: why do we want to support a single large address space for a process? Once again, the answer is convenience and ease of use. With a large address space, you don’t have to worry about if there is room enough in memory for your program’s data structures; rather, you just write the program naturally, allocating memory as needed. It is a powerful illusion that the OS provides, and makes your life vastly simpler.

Beyond just a single process, the addition of swap space allows the OS to support the illusion of a large virtual memory for multiple concurrently-running processes. The invention of multiprogramming (running multiple programs “at once”, to better utilize the machine) almost demanded the ability to swap out some pages, as early machines clearly could not hold all the pages needed by all processes at once. Thus, the combination of multiprogramming and ease-of-use leads us to want to support using more memory than is physically available.

## 21.1 Swap Space

The first thing we will need to do is to reserve some space on the disk for moving pages back and forth. In operating systems, we generally refer to such space as **swap space**, because we swap pages out of memory to it and swap pages into memory from it. Thus, we will simply assume that the OS can read from and write to the swap space, in page-sized units. To do so, the OS will need to remember the **disk address** of a given page.

The size of the swap space is important, as ultimately it determines the maximum number of memory pages that can be in use by a system at a given time. Let us assume for simplicity that it is very large for now.

In the tiny example (Figure 21.1), you can see a little example of a 4- page physical memory and an 8-page swap space. In the example, three processes (Proc 0, Proc 1, and Proc 2) are actively sharing physical memory; each of the three, however, only have some of their valid pages in memory, with the rest located in swap space on disk. A fourth process (Proc 3) has all of its pages swapped out to disk, and thus clearly isn’t currently running. One block of swap remains free. Even from this tiny example, hopefully you can see how using swap space allows the system to pretend that memory is larger than it actually is.

We should note that swap space is not the only on-disk location for swapping traffic. For example, assume you are running a program binary. The code pages from this binary are initially found on disk, and when the program runs, they are loaded into memory. However, if the system needs to make room in physical memory for other needs, it can safely re-use the memory space for these code pages, knowing that it can later swap them in again from the on-disk binary in the file system.

## 21.2 The Present Bit

Now that we have some space on the disk, we need to add some machinery higher up in the system in order to support swapping pages to and from the disk. Let us assume, for simplicity, that we have a system with a hardware-managed TLB.

Recall first what happens on a memory reference. The running process generates virtual memory references (for instruction fetches, or data accesses), and, in this case, the hardware translates them into physical addresses before fetching the desired data from memory.

Remember that the hardware first extracts the VPN from the virtual address, checks the TLB for a match (a **TLB hit**), and if a hit, produces the resulting physical address and fetches it from memory.

If the VPN is not found in the TLB (i.e., a **TLB miss**), the hardware locates the page table in memory (using the **page table base register**) and looks up the **page table entry** (**PTE**) for this page using the VPN as an index. If the page is valid and present in physical memory, the hardware extracts the PFN from the PTE, installs it in the TLB, and retries the instruction, this time generating a TLB hit; so far, so good.

If we wish to allow pages to be swapped to disk, however, we must add even more machinery. Specifically, when the hardware looks in the PTE, it may find that the page is not present in physical memory. The way the hardware (or the OS, in a software-managed TLB approach) determines this is through a new piece of information in each page-table entry, known as the **present bit**. If the present bit is set to one, it means the page is present in physical memory and everything proceeds as above; if it is set to zero, the page is not in memory but rather on disk somewhere. The act of accessing a page that is not in physical memory is commonly referred to as a **page fault**.

Upon a page fault, the OS is invoked to service the page fault. A particular piece of code, known as a **page-fault handler**, runs, and must service the page fault, as we now describe.

## 21.3 The Page Fault

Recall that with TLB misses, we have two types of systems: hardwaremanaged TLBs (where the hardware looks in the page table to find the desired translation) and software-managed TLBs (where the OS does). In either type of system, if a page is not present, the OS is put in charge to handle the page fault. The appropriately-named OS **page-fault handler** runs to determine what to do. Virtually all systems handle page faults in software; even with a hardware-managed TLB, the hardware trusts the OS to manage this important duty.

If a page is not present and has been swapped to disk, the OS will need to swap the page into memory in order to service the page fault. Thus, a question arises: how will the OS know where to find the desired page? In many systems, the page table is a natural place to store such information. Thus, the OS could use the bits in the PTE normally used for data such as the PFN of the page for a disk address. When the OS receives a page fault for a page, it looks in the PTE to find the address, and issues the request to disk to fetch the page into memory.

When the disk I/O completes, the OS will then update the page table to mark the page as present, update the PFN field of the page-table entry (PTE) to record the in-memory location of the newly-fetched page, and retry the instruction. This next attempt may generate a TLB miss, which would then be serviced and update the TLB with the translation (one could alternately update the TLB when servicing the page fault to avoid this step). Finally, a last restart would find the translation in the TLB and thus proceed to fetch the desired data or instruction from memory at the translated physical address.

Note that while the I/O is in flight, the process will be in the blocked state. Thus, the OS will be free to run other ready processes while the page fault is being serviced. Because I/O is expensive, this overlap of the I/O (page fault) of one process and the execution of another is yet another way a multiprogrammed system can make the most effective use of its hardware.

## 21.4 What If Memory Is Full?

In the process described above, you may notice that we assumed there is plenty of free memory in which to **page in** a page from swap space. Of course, this may not be the case; memory may be full (or close to it). Thus, the OS might like to first **page out** one or more pages to make room for the new page(s) the OS is about to bring in. The process of picking a page to kick out, or **replace** is known as the **page-replacement policy**.

As it turns out, a lot of thought has been put into creating a good page replacement policy, as kicking out the wrong page can exact a great cost on program performance. Making the wrong decision can cause a program to run at disk-like speeds instead of memory-like speeds. Thus, such a policy is something we should study in some detail; indeed, that is exactly what we will do in the next chapter. For now, it is good enough to understand that such a policy exists, built on top of the mechanisms described here.

## 21.5 Page Fault Control Flow

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (24).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

From the hardware control flow diagram in Figure 21.2, notice that there are now three important cases to understand when a TLB miss occurs. First, that the page was both present and valid (Lines 18–21); in this case, the TLB miss handler can simply grab the PFN from the PTE, retry the instruction (this time resulting in a TLB hit), and thus continue as described (many times) before. In the second case (Lines 22–23), the page fault handler must be run; although this was a legitimate page for the process to access (it is valid, after all), it is not present in physical memory. Third (and finally), the access could be to an invalid page, due for example to a bug in the program (Lines 13–14). In this case, no other bits in the PTE really matter; the hardware traps this invalid access, and the OS trap handler runs, likely terminating the offending process.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

From the software control flow in Figure 21.3, we can see what the OS roughly must do in order to service the page fault. First, the OS must find a physical frame for the soon-to-be-faulted-in page to reside within; if there is no such page, we’ll have to wait for the replacement algorithm to run and kick some pages out of memory, thus freeing them for use here.

With a physical frame in hand, the handler then issues the I/O request to read in the page from swap space. Finally, when that slow operation completes, the OS updates the page table and retries the instruction. The retry will result in a TLB miss, and then, upon another retry, a TLB hit, at which point the hardware will be able to access the desired item.

## 21.6 When Replacements Really Occur

Thus far, the way we’ve described how replacements occur assumes that the OS waits until memory is entirely full, and only then replaces (evicts) a page to make room for some other page. As you can imagine, this is a little bit unrealistic, and there are many reasons for the OS to keep a small portion of memory free more proactively.

To keep a small amount of memory free, most operating systems thus have some kind of high watermark (HW) and low watermark (LW) to help decide when to start evicting pages from memory. How this works is as follows: when the OS notices that there are fewer than LW pages available, a background thread that is responsible for freeing memory runs. The thread evicts pages until there are HW pages available. The background thread, sometimes called the **swap daemon** or **page daemon**, then goes to sleep, happy that it has freed some memory for running processes and the OS to use.

By performing a number of replacements at once, new performance optimizations become possible. For example, many systems will **cluster** or **group** a number of pages and write them out at once to the swap partition, thus increasing the efficiency of the disk; as we will see later when we discuss disks in more detail, such clustering reduces seek and rotational overheads of a disk and thus increases performance noticeably.

To work with the background paging thread, the control flow in Figure 21.3 should be modified slightly; instead of performing a replacement directly, the algorithm would instead simply check if there are any free pages available. If not, it would inform the background paging thread that free pages are needed; when the thread frees up some pages, it would re-awaken the original thread, which could then page in the desired page and go about its work.

## 21.7 Summary

In this brief chapter, we have introduced the notion of accessing more memory than is physically present within a system. To do so requires more complexity in page-table structures, as a **present bit** (of some kind) must be included to tell us whether the page is present in memory or not. When not, the operating system **page-fault handler** runs to service the **page fault**, and thus arranges for the transfer of the desired page from disk to memory, perhaps first replacing some pages in memory to make room for those soon to be swapped in.
